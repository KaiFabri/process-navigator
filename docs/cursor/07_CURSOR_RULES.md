# Cursor Rules (Mandatory)

Cursor must:
- Read docs in /docs/cursor before coding
- Never invent schema fields
- Never skip validation rules
- Prefer explicit code over abstraction
- Ask before adding new concepts
- Treat Airtable as authoritative state

Forbidden:
- Silent schema changes
- Client-side state as source of truth
- Implicit joins or inferred logic
- Canvas layout driving execution logic
